  <p>Every nightmare I have starts out as a dream</p>
  <p>At first, I always seem to find myself</p>
  <p>Cradling and craving the ocean blue</p>
  <p>If I could have a beach day everyday</p>
  <p>I would, but it wouldn’t like yours</p>
  <p>No raunchy romance novel tucked</p>
  <p>Under banana boat, white claws</p>
  <p>Clinking together in the tote like</p>
  <p>Lobsters in a tank</p>
  <p>You would not find me</p>
  <p>Basking my pale skin in the sun</p>
  <p>My skin will find the sun</p>
  <p>Organically as it is meant to</p>
  <p>Without summoning or pleading</p>
  <p>The island girl in me coming</p>
  <p>Through like a medium</p>
  <p>I will leave the beach a shade</p>
  <p>No one can quite describe</p>
  <p>And I like it that way</p>
  <p>I will not be tangled up in some</p>
  <p>Boy’s arms like a ship</p>
  <p>Who has strayed far too away from shore</p>
  <p>My lips will be smothered in sun spots</p>
  <p>Kissing the edge of a spliff</p>
  <p>My own hands will weave and wrap</p>
  <p>Around my thimble, fragile self</p>
  <p>I will expose my top</p>
  <p>But never the bottom</p>
  <p>Bearing my open chest to the world</p>
  <p>And dipping it into the pool’s of eyes</p>
  <p>Surrounding me like an oar</p>
  <p>I come here to think and release</p>
  <p>It always starts out this way</p>
  <p>I will look at the vast water</p>
  <p>With jealous and envy</p>
  <p>How it flows in complete harmony</p>
  <p>How it never scolds itself for</p>
  <p>its waves becoming too powerful and consuming</p>
  <p>How it can be what it is without spending it’s time</p>
  <p>Obsessed with what it is not</p>
  <p>The questioning and the doubt</p>
  <p>It just moves without reason or fault</p>
  <p>Oblivious like a child</p>
  <p>I release the projections and the lies I feed to myself</p>
  <p>Like baby sea turtles groping blindly for the sea</p>
  <p>Return the fables I’ve made up back to the earth</p>
  <p>I been running to the shore</p>
  <p>To whisper my sins and explorations of debauchery</p>
  <p>My fears and my incantations like</p>
  <p>Confession, communion</p>
  <p>Go for a quick baptismal dip</p>
  <p>In the shallow neck</p>
  <p>Creep in and emerge from the underbelly</p>
  <p>A new beast like a captive alligator</p>
  <p>Renewal</p>
  <p>in the bath as a kid</p>
  <p>I would always stay in far too long</p>
  <p>And when my skin got all crinkled and wrinkled</p>
  <p>I thought I was growing old before my eyes</p>
  <p>My dad would laugh and say</p>
  <p><b><em>“It’s just alligator skin”</em></b></p>
  <p>He is always on the prowl</p>
  <p>In my dream this is where the mutation happens</p>
  <p>A new dawn turned dark</p>
  <p>The sun will start to go down, down</p>
  <p>My skin will grow far too cold and impatient</p>
  <p>I will pack up my mind and spirit</p>
  <p>Double checking I have not forgotten</p>
  <p>Anything before I make the long journey</p>
  <p>Home</p>
  <p>That’s when he always finds me</p>
  <p>And I think</p>
  <p><b><em>“I knew I was forgetting something”</em></b></p>
  <p>And he will say</p>
  <p><b><em>“How could you forget about me”</em></b></p>
  <p>And I will say I have in many ways</p>
  <p>Like I can no longer recall once I wake</p>
  <p>What my father looks like</p>
  <p>I mean I know the basics right?</p>
  <p>The color of the hair and the eyes</p>
  <p>That starchy white ghost skin</p>
  <p>I cannot take you with me</p>
  <p>So I start running bare feet</p>
  <p>My tiny toes slapping the pavement</p>
  <p>Like a beluga’s body meeting the water</p>
  <p>Once more, I dive back up for air</p>
  <p>You chase me and I run, run, run</p>
  <p>I try to make myself small so you</p>
  <p>Cant’ see me but you seem to always</p>
  <p>Be doing that on your own</p>
  <p>Besides this was to be my dream away from home</p>
  <p>My family tree never been no safe house</p>
  <p>You never catch me</p>
  <p>It’s all about the chase for you</p>
  <p>And for me the destination</p>
  <p>I will come back to the beach day</p>
  <p>Once more lucidly</p>
  <p>Even though I know you may be a lingering sun shadow</p>
  <p>stalking up alongside me</p>
  <p>Painting different pictures and scary figurines</p>
  <p>Into my head like sigils in the clouds</p>
  <p>Every nightmare I have starts out as a dream</p>
  <p>Try as I might, how I try to forget</p>
